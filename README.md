# houses-for-rent-Germany
This project has the objective to use web scraping to collect rental houses and apartments in main Germany cities for use in further analysis.

Germany geojson source: https://github.com/isellsoap/deutschlandGeoJSON 

## The Problem:

- In a few months I'll move to Germany, so, I need to rent a house to live in. With this problem, I decided to scrape a german rent houses web site in order to collect infos about prices, conditions, if pets are allowed (I'll take a huge dog and a little cat with me, my pets) an so on.
